# Image-Editor

This project is an image editor that was created in March 2024 as part of Northeastern Universityâ€™s CS 2510: Fundamentals of Computer Science 2. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to remove columns from the image as they wish using the provided toolsets. The user can remove the bluest column, a random column, and undo any of the edits they make. Additionally, the user can change the image to any image they upload to the program.
